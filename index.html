			<h1>Kravchinskaya Margarita</h1>
<p>I am twenty one years old.
I am a student of the Civil Inginiring faculty (building - is a very interesting field of activity) , but I dream about a programmer career.
Programmers have a big salary.<br>
I am studied in Itclass in my sity(Gomel). I learn CSS and HTML. Also I know basic programming in language ะก.
I did several sites on patterns.<br>
I am a fourth year student of the Belarusian State University of Transport. 
Once I got to the Epam lab at the university. I wrote a follow-up assignment in C.
But in the courses everyone knew java well and I decided that I needed to prepare better. 
Now I am here.<br>
I know the next languages: Russian, Belarussian. I also know English, but my level is not high (A1).
I plan learn English in near future.</p>
